Good:
Messages sometimes don't have clear meanings. Emojis clarifie them.
I can imagine the other person's face while reading the message.
It expresses emotions.
Some of them can replace a whole message - for example like, dislike, sad face or laughing face

Bad:
People tend to overuse emojis. A lot.
Some emoji sets look so bad it makes me wanna cry, especially animated emoji sets.
